How to update/upgrade Linux:
What does APT do?

APT (Advanced Packaging Tool) is a set of core tools found inside the Debian operating system. It provides utilities for the installation and removal of software packages and dependencies on a system.

apt is a subset of apt-get and apt-cache commands providing necessary commands for package management.
while apt-get wonâ€™t be deprecated, as a regular user, you should start using apt more often.

`sudo apt install`
	Installs a package

`sudo apt remove`
	Removes a package

`sudo apt purge`
	Removes package with configuration

`sudo apt update`
	Refreshes repository index

`sudo apt upgrade`
	Upgrades all upgradable packages
	
`sudo apt autoremove`
	Removes unwanted packages
	
`sudo apt full-upgrade`
	Upgrades packages with auto-handling of dependencies
	
`sudo apt search`
	Searches for a program 

`sudo apt show`
	Shows package details
	
`sudo apt list`
	Lists packages with criteria (installed, upgradable etc)

`sudo apt edit-sources`
	edits sources list

`sudo apt clean`
	The clean command clears out the local repository of downloaded package files. It removes everything except the partials folder and lock file from /var/cache/apt/archives/. Use apt clean to free up disk space when necessary, or as part of regularly scheduled maintenance.

`sudo apt autoclean`
	autoclean is another method used to clear out the local repository of downloaded package files, just like clean. The difference between clean and autoclean is that the latter only removes package files that can no longer be downloaded from their sources, and are very likely to be useless.
